<p>
The present work proposes the anomaly based intrusion detection approach applying machine learning techniques, to deal with the complexity of the normal behavior model and the high data flow of networks. 
</p>

<p>
Intrusion detection systems play an important role in ensuring information security by anticipating attacks and mitigating the damage caused. Thus, it enables data recovery and service restoration, minimizing the losses caused by exposure time and system downtime.
</p>

<p>
The results obtained show good performance of the anomaly-based detection approach in the Random Forests, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks techniques, which can be applied to meet different corporate objectives, standards and extension of information security laws
